# SILAS' KEYPAD
Silas' hackpad project created with help from Hackclub! I plan to use this project as a numpad for blender 3d software. The keypad is a four by two grid and contains 2 status LEDs. The PCB was created in KICAD and the cad models were created in Fusion.

## Cad
All cad was created in Fusion 360 through Education. I really enjoyed using bevels on the edges to make it feel truely polished. All four eight holes in the base will be fitted with threaded inserts and they holes will use M3 bolts.
